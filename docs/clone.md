# Cloning a GitHub Repository

By cloning the GitHub repository, you copy the project from the remote location to your local computer. The purpose of cloning a remote GitHub Repository is so that you write code locally and push the modified content to the remote repository. 


## How to Clone a Repository:
1. Go to the repository you want to clone on GitHub.
2. Click on "Code".
3. Copy the URL that pops up.
4. Go to the Welcome Screen of PyCharm.
