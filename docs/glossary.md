# Glossary


Term        | Definition
----------------- | -----------------
Branch | A parallel version of a repository that allows developers to work on different features or bugfixes simultaneously without affecting the main codebase.
Breakpoint | A marker placed in the code where the debugger will pause execution, allowing programmers to examine the state of the program.
Build | The process of converting source code into an executable program or library.
Clone | Creating a local copy of a remote repository.
Commit | A set of changes to a repository, usually accompanied by a message describing the changes.
Debugger | A tool used to detect and fix errors (bugs) in code, enabling programmers to monitor the execution of their programs and examine the state of the program and its variables at specific points in the code.
Exception Breakpoints | Breakpoints that suspend the program when exceptions are thrown.
Force Run to Cursor | A debugger action that continues running the program until the position of the caret is reached, ignoring all breakpoints encountered along the way.
Force Step Into | A debugger action that steps into a method even if it is skipped by the normal Step Into.
Force Step Over | A debugger action that moves to the next line of code, ignoring any breakpoints present within the called methods.
Fork | A personal copy of another user's repository that allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.
Frame | In the context of programming, a frame represents the currently active method or function call, containing the local variables, arguments, and code context necessary for expression evaluation.
Gutter | For our purposes, a gutter is the vertical area on the left side of the code editor window. It usually displays various indicators, such as line numbers, breakpoints, and error or warning icons.
IDE | Integrated Development Environment, a software application that provides a suite of tools for software development.
Jump to Cursor | A debugger action that halts the execution of the program and jumps to the line where the caret is currently located, bypassing any breakpoints encountered along the way.
Line Breakpoints | Breakpoints that suspend the program on reaching the line of code with the breakpoint.
Merge Conflict | A situation where two branches have conflicting changes and require manual intervention to resolve the differences.
Pull Request | A request to merge changes from one branch to another, often used for code review and collaboration.
Repository | A storage location where code and related files are stored, often used for version control.
Run to Cursor | A debugger action that continues running the program until the position of the caret is reached.
Smart Step Into | A debugger action that allows selection of a specific method call to step into when there are multiple method calls on a single line.
Step Into | A debugger action that moves into a method to view its execution.
Step Into My Code | A debugger action that stops the debugger from stepping into library classes, focusing on the user's code.
Step Out | A debugger action that exits the current method and moves to the caller method.
Step Over | A debugger action that proceeds to the next line of code, skipping any method calls present in the current line.
Stepping | The process of controlling the execution of a program step-by-step.
